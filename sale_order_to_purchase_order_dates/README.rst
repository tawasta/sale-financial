=============================================
Sale Order to Purchase Order - Date Extension
=============================================

* Looks at 1) the requested delivery date given by the end customer of a sale
  order and 2) the usual delivery delay of the vendor that is dropshipping the
  goods to them.
* When creating a purchase order from the sale, the delay information is used
  to compensate and suggest an earlier requested delivery date from the
  vendor.
* Intended for situations where vendors are known to often dropship goods
  late, so that there is a buffer between the requested delivery and the
  actual date when end customer needs the goods.

Configuration
=============
* Go to the vendor form and fill in the new "Delivery delay to end customer"
  field

Usage
=====
* Click the "Create RFQ" button on the Sale Order form. Select a vendor and
  edit the Requested delivery date field if necessary. Print a purchase order.
